# Mapping_Earthquakes


## Overview

Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map. I was tasked with the deliverables of adding tectonic plate data as well as adding major earthquakde data. 


The earthquakes are shown in relation to the Earth's tectonic plates for an easy visual.
